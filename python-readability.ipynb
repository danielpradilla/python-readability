Mr. Milivojevic (Serbia) said that, in June 2011, his Government had adopted the Strategy and Development Policy of Serbian industry for the. period 2011-2020, which defined basic development priorities and the ways to achieve them. The Government\\'s goal was to attain sustainable and dynamic industrial growth that could be integrated in the single market of the European Union and thus be able to compete with other member countries. Macroeconomic stability was impossible without stable industrial growth. The strategy, which set out a new model of economic growth for the next decade, was particularly relevant in the light of the global financial and economic crisis. It focused on export activities, particularly on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises, and foreign direct investment, which brought new capital, more qualified staff, modern technology, efficient management and a new corporate culture. The privatization and restructuring process should be completed as soon as possible. Serbia had a long-term competitive advantage in the form of knowledge, which should be put to use through education reform, research, applied innovations and faster development of new information and communication technologies. Special attention should be paid to reviving devastated industrial centres and embarking on sustainable regional development. Serbia expected industrial production to double by 2020, compared with 2010, and labour productivity to increase substantially. The share of exported goods in the gross domestic product (GDP) should reach. 50 per cent in 2020, there should be 10 per cent average annual investments growth and the average annual inflow of foreign direct investment should reach Euro2.35 billion. To achieve such results, Serbia would strive to create dynamic and sustainable industrial development, enhance the investment environment, make energy use and environmental protection more effective, and restructure the export system. At the same time, the education system should be reformed in order to fulfil the potential of the economy and there should be active cooperation between industry and science. Incentives would be provided for innovation, research and development. Such measures would be implemented on the basis of an action plan that was due to come into force by the end of 2011. The Government had set an ambitious reform agenda, with membership of the European Union as its central strategic priority. His delegation hoped that the combined strength of the United Nations system would continue to assist the country in advancing its aims, within the framework of good governance and sustainable development. The country remained committed to full implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. Activities to promote cleaner industrial development and provide assistance to developing countries in the field of renewable energy and carbon emissions reduction should be considered priorities. UNIDO should promote the Green Industry Initiative at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Mr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia) commended UNIDO on its success in mobilizing new. resources and providing technical cooperation. The Director-General\\'s report was most informative, describing not only what was being done to promote energy efficiency but also what could and needed to be done to promote basic energy and environmental goals. He expressed gratitude to the Director-General for his endeavours to make UNIDO more effective and efficient and for his tireless pursuit of sustainable and green development. The theme of the session -- the new industrial revolution -- was timely in addressing the challenges facing the world. Green industry was essential to sustainable development. In a world of growing interdependence, it was imperative to tackle the challenges more inclusively. Moreover, sustainable development facilitated by green industry and green energy was at the heart of the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals and a better future in general. In that connection, he expressed gratitude for the UNIDO forum on the new industrial revolution, which, together with the high-level meetings held in Vienna in 2010 on energy and green industry and the Sustainable Energy for All initiative, could be seen as building blocks for the success of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Sustainable development and greener economies could be achieved only by restructuring the twentieth-century economic model, based as it was on the extensive use of oil and other fossil fuels. Such restructuring would, however, be painful. His country\\'s economy was based on agriculture and mining, the latter accounting for 30 per cent of GDP and 80 per cent of exports. The Government was, however, working to ensure that mining made the least possible impact on the environment. The real challenge was how to move from a resource-based economy to a resource-efficient one. The Government was going in for innovation, less pollutant technologies and the best practices of other countries. Moving away from coal and oil as primary sources of energy would, however, take years. Ultimately, the Government\\'s policy was \"development for the people and the people for development\". Climate change -- which was not of the country\\'s own making -- had had a significant impact on the sustainable development of agriculture. In 2009, Mongolia had lost almost 10 million head of livestock, or 20 per cent of the entire livestock population, in an extremely cold winter. Prolonged drought over the past few years throughout the country, especially in the Gobi Desert, was also causing water shortages in many places, forcing nomads to migrate to other areas, where the concentration of livestock further burdened the pasture land and prevented it from regenerating properly. Almost 90 per cent of the territory had become vulnerable to desertification and land degradation. Aware of the challenges of sustainable development, Mongolia had turned to UNIDO for advice and assistance. UNIDO experts had, with Mongolian colleagues, done an extensive analysis of the country\\'s manufacturing sectors and formulated practical recommendations on how best to develop a competitive, sustainable and diversified industry. The recommendations had been extremely useful. The experience vividly demonstrated that policy advice and expertise should be among the most important aspects of the Organization\\'s services, as reflected in the. draft resolution submitted by the Group of 77 and China, entitled \"Activities in the field of industrial policy with a view to promoting social inclusion\". Mr. Voronetsky (Belarus) said that the theme for the current session of the Conference and the work of the forum on industrial development issues and regional round tables all highlighted the urgent need to work out new intellectual and political strategies to promote sustainable industrial development. It became ever clearer that the traditional models of industrial development and consumption were becoming increasingly less practicable. It had come to be understood that global stability and security required a transition to a new, green model of economic and industrial development. UNIDO, as a key member of the United Nations family, should be at the forefront of efforts to establish a green industry policy and strategy. Technologies for new and renewable sources of energy had already long existed and were working effectively. The main challenge was to ensure the transfer of such technologies to developing States and States with economies in transition and to facilitate their use, thus raising the energy-effectiveness of developing countries. The way forward might be to set up a global mechanism with clear rules on providing access to such technologies for all countries, in the interests of the common good and the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. Such a mechanism would make a serious contribution to the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All, which would be held in 2012, and UNIDO should play an active role in the process. Belarus also considered it essential to promote cooperation between technology transfer centres at the international, regional and bilateral levels. Such cooperation would undoubtedly be conducive to the transfer and effective use by developing States and countries with economies in transition of the technologies of new and renewable sources of energy. A good example was the establishment of the Technology Transfer Centre of the member States of the Eurasian Economic Community, currently being set up by UNIDO, where the member States of the Community were working ever more closely with each other on technology transfer. His delegation welcomed the activities of UNIDO in drawing up a plan of action on green industry, given that a green economy was crucial to a State\\'s sustainable social and economic development. Those activities must, however, respect the different rates at which the basic principles of the green economy were adopted by each State, depending on its level of social and economic development, its national circumstances and the real options available to it. It was an issue on which countries should work together. An important practical step towards such cooperation was contained in the final documents of international conferences, including the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), which set out environmental protection measures and international commitments to the cause of sustainable development and wide access to green technologies. Industrial development was crucial to the economy of Belarus. The strategy for the coming years was to raise growth rates through modernization, improved production structures and enhanced competitiveness by improving the quality of goods. The country sought to make the transition to new. up-to-date technologies and to produce goods that met the demands of the high-technology world market. Among the priorities for industrial policy were energy efficiency, new and renewable sources of energy, information and telecommunication technologies and industrial biotechnologies. Ms. Mungoi (Mozambique) said that her country benefited from the assistance of UNIDO in various ways, including the implementation of the business environment support and trade facilitation project under the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries 2001-2010. Some progress had been made, but much remained to be done. Countries like Mozambique had failed to reap the full benefits of globalization, since, to reduce poverty, countries had to grow both rapidly and sustainably. Economic growth depended on improved supply-side capacity, competitiveness, effective trade and investment policies and a business environment that could attract domestic and foreign investment. UNIDO could assist her country, as it assisted many developing countries, in providing the appropriate skills, technology transfer and institutional capacity-building. Mozambique had considerable mineral resources, including gas and coal, which her Government was confident could lead to steady economic growth. Her delegation commended UNIDO on the adoption of the Strategy and Operational Plan for. the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020. Mozambique was committed to the implementation of the Programme of Action in full cooperation with UNIDO and other development partners through regional and South-South cooperation initiatives in all areas, including productive capacity, agriculture, food security, rural development and human and social development. Mr. Ketso (Lesotho) said that the theme of the current session of the General Conference -- \"The new industrial revolution -- making it sustainable\" -- was appropriate, especially in the context of the run-up to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), since it enabled the international community to take stock of the current situation and assess what should have been achieved. Despite some progress, many of the goals that had been set were still far from being accomplished, such as alleviating poverty, creating wealth, ensuring fair trade in the global arena and providing access to clean water and sanitation. As a country that had greatly benefited from the support of UNIDO, Lesotho welcomed the Director-General\\'s report on the Organization\\'s activities. Lesotho supported the initiatives of UNIDO to promote the structural transformation of the least developed countries (LDCs), establish energy as a key pillar of industrial growth, poverty alleviation and wealth creation, and promote sustainable development through a green economy. Lesotho had set itself the target of progressing from LDC status by 2020. It had also set the target of 60 per cent rural electrification by 2020, in view of the importance of industrialization for economic and social development. UNIDO had supported the Government\\'s efforts by providing technical assistance in industrial upgrading and modernization and by supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. In particular, it had supported the wool and mohair industry and the hides and skin sector. It also participated in a partnership with the Government and the company Philips Design to manufacture energy-efficient smokeless cooking stoves. The factory would employ over 300 people and produce more than 300,000 such stoves a year for the local and regional market. In June 2011, Lesotho and six other African nations had joined the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, an initiative launched by Ms. Hillary Clinton, the United States Secretary of State. The aim was to reach 20 million African homes with clean stoves and fuels by 2020, which would save time previously lost in gathering fuel and would curb indoor pollution and respiratory illness. At its peak, in 2006, the textile industry in Lesotho had employed more than 40,000 people. Owing to the economic downturn and lower demand for African clothes, half that number had lost their jobs. The Government had therefore embarked on a diversification programme in other sectors, including agribusiness, tourism, manufacturing and, above all, renewable energy. Jointly with South Africa, Lesotho was launching green energy projects, starting early in 2012, to generate 6,000 megawatts of wind power and 4,000 megawatts of hydropower over the next 10 years. The schemes would create 25,000 jobs and require a permanent staff of 1,500 technicians and engineers. The hope was to make Lesotho the renewable energy hub of sub-Saharan Africa. Mr. Bounteum (Lao People\\'s Democratic Republic), speaking as Chair of the Vienna Committee of the Ambassadors/Permanent Representatives of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), expressed gratitude for the leadership of the. Director-General in implementing the Programme for Change and Organizational Renewal and organizing the Ministerial Meeting on Energy and Green Industry and the Vienna Energy Forum 2011. The. ASEAN-Vienna Committee welcomed the outcome of the LDC Ministerial Conference held the previous week and, in particular, the adoption of the UNIDO LDC Strategy and Operational Plan 2012-2020 for the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action. All the guidelines and decisions adopted and the experiences shared would substantially assist the ASEAN member countries in advancing their development efforts and facilitating their application of best practices, advanced technologies and expertise to industrial development and expansion, taking into account the specific needs of their people and the characteristics of their environment. ASEAN was in the process of building the ASEAN Community, one aspect of which was economic. The ASEAN countries therefore needed to strengthen cooperation with UNIDO, other Member States and development partners in the areas of capacity-building, human resource development and transfer of technology and suitable equipment in order to enable them to implement their national and regional strategies for food security, water security and energy security. Technical cooperation with UNIDO was crucial to the realization of the ASEAN countries\\' regional and international legal obligations with regard to environmental protection and particularly the use and management of sea and river water resources for comprehensive, balanced and sustainable development. Such action was particularly required at a time when many countries in the region had been heavily affected by severe natural disasters, including floods. The ASEAN countries appreciated the decision to declare 2012 the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All and looked forward to participating in the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), in the hope that all the parties concerned would fulfil their international legal obligations for the benefit of all. In that connection, he expressed gratitude for the valuable contributions made by development partners, including the European Union, to various technical cooperation projects to mitigate the greenhouse effects of global warming and provide technical assistance and support for developing nations. Mr. Annan (Ghana) said that the Director-General\\'s report demonstrated the commitment of UNIDO to eradicating poverty through technical cooperation and other forms of support for industrial activities in Member States, including Ghana. In collaboration with UNIDO, the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Ghana had organized a two-day policy conference for ministers of industry, energy and environment in West African countries on the theme \"Competitiveness and diversification: strategy challenges in a petroleum-rich economy\". The success of the conference had been such that Ghana would hold a regular annual conference on the subject. His Government had introduced legislation to protect oil revenue, which would be used to finance a broad diversification of the economy. Efforts were also under way to use natural gas and other forms of renewable energy, in addition to hydropower, to produce electricity for industrial development. Natural gas would also be used to produce fertilizer and develop a petrochemical industry. In June 2011, after its finds of oil and gas, Ghana had launched its industrial policy and industrial sector support programme, which had four components: production and distribution, technology and innovation, incentives and regulations. The Government had also embarked on the strengthening of agribusiness and the agro-processing industry, with the emphasis on marine products, fruit and vegetables, oilseed, cotton and textiles. A top priority for the country\\'s national youth development policy was to develop the capacity of young people for industrial activities. Ghana would welcome any assistance with the training of young people in entrepreneurship, evolving trends in global business and global financing. Technical cooperation between Ghana and UNIDO under the medium-term programme. framework 2008-2011 had yielded good results. The cooperation included a programme to build the capacity of public standard institutions in Ghana and a project to strengthen the local production of essential generic medicines for Ghana and other countries in West Africa. A road map to improve food manufacturing practice had been most useful in assisting more small pharmaceutical firms to become listed among the top 100 enterprises in Ghana. UNIDO had also, jointly with the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), provided training for 2,000 refugees in UNHCR settlements in Buduburam and Krisan to enable them to become self-employed. Another project related to the Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem, in which 16 countries in West and Central Africa were taking part and which was executed by UNIDO with funding from the Global Environmental Facility. The second phase of the programme in 2012 would involve the transfer of sound environmental technology and cooperation between the Government and the offshore gas and oil industry on oil-spill preventive measures. Mr. Sichinga (Zambia) said that the theme of the current session of the General Conference -- \"The new industrial revolution -- making it sustainable\" -- would be even more appropriate if the words \"and more equitable\" were added. Zambia noted with satisfaction the constant strengthening of various UNIDO programmes under the able leadership of the Director-General, who had brought great vigour to the Organization. For Zambia, which was among the least developed countries, the focus on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises as well as broad value chain enterprises was particularly welcome. Zambia had been a beneficiary of UNIDO support for national quality standards through its capacity-building for the procurement and standards procedures of the Zambia Bureau of Standards and the Zambia Weights and Measures Agency. Generally, however, UNIDO programmes needed to be implemented in a more focused way, ensuring that programme resources were not spread too thinly. UNIDO ought also to take cognizance of initiatives taking place within the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), of which the LDCs were members. Zambia urged the establishment of centres of excellence in all States, specially tailored to accord with each country\\'s circumstances. In that connection, Zambia offered itself as a pilot country for the integrated approach. The Government sought to grow the economy on the basis of the country\\'s natural endowments by concentrating on five primary agricultural projects and developing rural or regional clusters throughout the. 74 districts that made up Zambia. The privatization of some 300 previously. State-owned enterprises in Zambia in the 1990s had. not achieved the expected outcome in terms of development. Indeed, it had been a retrograde step, since it had reversed the first moves towards industrialization that had already been taken by 1990. Investment and the exploitation of natural resources, such as minerals, had excluded the majority of citizens. Profits had been massive, but there had been little reinvestment. The so-called neo-liberal model had led to social crisis. Zambians themselves did not benefit from the growth in GDP that had averaged 6-7 per cent over the previous 10 years. The country\\'s economy was rated one of the 10 fastest-growing in Africa, yet there had been no employment growth: the total labour force in the formal sector was a mere half million out of a total population of 13 million, 68 per cent of whom were young people. Some 4-5 million young people were currently unemployed. While 14,000 entered tertiary institutions every year, 300,000 more entered the job market from primary or secondary schools or universities, with little prospect of finding employment, given that only 5,000 jobs became available annually. Dissatisfaction with the situation had led to a change of Government two months earlier. The challenge of creating opportunities for the. millions of young people could be met only if a new approach was adopted. The aim was therefore to harness the energies of the young population in a productive and innovative way. The foreign investments in enterprises that exploited the mineral resources of Zambia had made a minimal contribution to taxes. While mining production had accounted for over 10 per cent of GDP in 2010, its contribution to taxes was under 2 per cent. Indeed, foreign investors sought ever more tax exemptions, while taking no responsibility for the environmental damage that they caused. There was a clear need for a paradigm shift towards greater sustainability and economic equality. The youth of Zambia would accept nothing less than the good jobs and the business opportunities available elsewhere. UNIDO programmes offered possibilities through vocational training and entrepreneurship development aimed at improving the functional literacy of the young and providing productive work for young people, changing them from job seekers to job creators. Such programmes were also useful in developing the value chain and the supply chain, matching the supplier with the buyer, accelerating the pace of exports through export consortia and promoting industrial diversification. Zambia wished to be part of the third industrial development wave by implementing policy reforms, as promoted by UNIDO, using its own raw products, with the participation of its own citizens. The programmes that it sought to implement would be directed towards micro, small and medium-sized agriculture and agribusiness, because the country had large tracts of arable land, of which only 6 per cent was currently under cultivation. After three years of bumper harvests, however, Zambia was self-sufficient in maize, wheat and other food commodities and, indeed, had enough for export. Moreover, it had within or along. its borders 40 per cent of the water resources. in southern Africa and therefore considerable hydropower potential. It currently produced less than. 2,000 megawatts of electricity, but its potential could be stretched to at least 6,000, and perhaps. 10,000 megawatts, using small hydropower stations. UNIDO was helping Zambia revise its industrial development policy, which aimed to harmonize local linkages with local direct investment, targeting industrial clusters in rural areas. A primary resource endowment audit was being carried out in each province and district, which it was hoped to finish by February 2012. He expressed gratitude for the activities of UNIDO and countries and organizations such as the European Union that supported specific UNIDO programmes. He called on more developed. middle-income countries, such as Brazil, China, India, South Africa, Turkey and the Arab countries to do more to support the South-South initiatives of UNIDO. His country\\'s industrial advance would be no threat to developed countries and would, indeed, be beneficial to them. Ms. Mapunjo (United Republic of Tanzania) expressed her delegation\\'s gratitude for the leadership of the Director-General and the activities of UNIDO in helping developing countries achieve industrialization. Her country\\'s partnership with UNIDO was of great assistance in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The \"Delivering as One\" initiative had helped Tanzanian products to enter the market, provided support for small and medium-sized enterprises. and upgraded the value chains of tradable commodities. The current activities of UNIDO included capacity-building for policy formulation and industrial competitiveness, technology upgrading and partnership exchange programmes for industries seeking to improve their efficiency. Thanks to the efforts of UNIDO and other development partners, her country was more than halfway to attaining the Millennium Development Goals. It had, however, been difficult to attain them in full, the reason being that the Goals had been predicated on social activities. There was a missing link, in the form of strategies to improve the productive and trade sectors, which could lead to job creation, skills development and trade. Growth, to be attained by adding value to agricultural produce and natural resources and improving standards and marketing, was crucial to attaining the Goals. More resources should be put into industrial transformation, which was a prerequisite for economic growth and therefore poverty reduction. In her country, the industrialization agenda had been given the highest priority. The economy was expected to be semi-industrialized by 2025, in accordance with the Tanzania Development. Vision 2025. Under the five-year plan 2011-2016, the manufacturing sector, including agribusiness and. agro-processing, was among the top three priority sectors. The Kilimo Kwanza (Agriculture First) initiative aimed to ensure food security and sustainability. Compliance with environmental requirements and an adequate green energy supply were crucial to sustainability. Consumers were becoming increasingly aware and required businesses to implement sustainable production processes and practices. Africa emitted fewer greenhouse gases than any other part of the world, largely owing to its low level of industrialization. At the same time, it was the most threatened by climate change. The international community had the responsibility to adopt mitigation measures, particularly by mainstreaming sustainable production and consumption in industrial development. In the light of the challenges imposed by climate change, the mandate of the Cleaner Production Centre in Tanzania had been changed in April 2005 so as to focus on making industrial development more sustainable. Small and medium-sized enterprises could be a powerful force in ensuring industrial sustainability, once a proper partnership was forged between them and the large corporations. In Tanzania, 94 per cent of enterprises were small or medium-sized and they were crucial to job creation. Yet such enterprises did not receive due attention in the legislation of developing countries. It was clear to African countries that an abundance of natural resources did not necessarily guarantee long-term success in development. Science and technology were equally important; and UNIDO made an important contribution to the continent\\'s progress in that regard. She urged the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to make industrial transformation a top priority and to provide the necessary funds. Mr. Rivera Mora (El Salvador) said that the financial crisis that had hit the leading powers of the world, primarily in Europe, with a consequent impact on developing countries, clearly showed that the international economic system that had predominated to date was no longer effective. Action taken by States to stabilize their economies showed that the market was unable on its own to control financial imbalances. In other words, before the crisis became uncontrollable, serious thought should be given to restructuring the international economic and financial architecture to make it more equitable and inclusive, taking into account the social dimension of sustainable development. For the developing countries, particularly El Salvador, a combination of factors, including natural disasters, high oil and food prices and climate change, had led to lower exports and productivity, and therefore higher unemployment, which caused serious economic and social problems that threatened democratic stability. A financial crisis that the developing countries had not created nonetheless seriously affected their efforts to combat extreme poverty and to attain the Millennium Development Goals. International organizations and institutions dealing with economic and social development should therefore be reformed in order to fit in with the international reality. They should reflect the interests of all countries, including developing and least developed countries. El Salvador thus commended the new direction in which the Director-General was taking UNIDO, with the emphasis on the sustainability of the new industrial revolution. The allocation of programmes and technical cooperation projects must, however, be based on a fair geographical balance. It should be borne in mind that Latin America and the Caribbean consisted not only of emerging countries but also of many with lower levels of development and growth, which should also be provided with more technical, scientific and financial cooperation. He therefore urged the developed countries that contributed to the Industrial Development Fund and the trust funds to bear in mind the needs of the relatively less developed countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, especially in Central America. El Salvador was going through a process of change, which included a new vision of development based on justice, equality and social inclusion. The Government was building a new, productive and efficient economy that would generate sufficient good jobs and establish a new industrial and agro-industrial policy aimed at increasing national production for both domestic consumption and export. In that connection, he expressed gratitude to the Director-General and the Chief of the UNIDO Latin America and the Caribbean Programme for their technical advice in support of the new policy. He also expressed gratitude to the Director-General for making it possible for several Salvadorian women to gain employment at UNIDO Headquarters in Vienna. In an interdependent world, international cooperation was crucial to overcoming the challenges that confronted both developing and developed countries with regard to the environment, energy and food security, among others. Joint action was needed, but naturally there were qualitative and quantitative differences in the abilities of States to respond. The international community should pass from unilateral to collective action as soon as possible in order to achieve the human, habitable and sustainable world to which every country aspired. Mr. Benmeradi (Algeria) said that the sustainability of the new industrial revolution -- the theme of the current session of the General Conference -- would not be possible if the financial excesses that had led to the rise of the virtual economy and the demise of the productive economy persisted. The uncontrolled disorder of the economic and financial system, aggravated by the sovereign debts of large industrialized nations and the prospect of a recession that would seriously affect the world economy, weakening still further the countries of the South, was not acceptable. The transition to a prudent economy required greater collective efforts to improve the rules governing the international financial system and reduce the egregious inequalities of globalization, which compromised international and regional peace and stability. The current changes in the Middle East and North Africa and the protest movements in the industrialized countries showed how worrying the situation was. Meanwhile, domestic demand must be increased in some countries of the South and efforts by the developed countries to relaunch a productive economy must be redoubled. The climate was favourable for. the establishment of mutually beneficial partnerships. and the revitalization of cooperation, including. South-South cooperation, in which UNIDO could play a catalysing role. In that context, Algeria greatly appreciated the advice and assistance of UNIDO, particularly in the formulation of effective strategies and policies in a rapidly changing world. UNIDO should continue its efforts to promote various aspects of the industrial revolution, including productive activities for young people, competitiveness, new and renewable energy and clean technology. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) would provide an opportunity to assess the progress made and consider how to achieve closer integration between environmental concerns and industrial production systems. UNIDO had shown the way through its green industry programme. The Director-General had visited Algeria in October 2010. On that occasion, two agreements had been signed, one on modernizing and upgrading the food processing sector and the other on strengthening capacity for the environmentally rational management of persistent organic pollutants and the destruction. of hazardous waste. The two projects supported. the Government\\'s efforts under the five-year. plan 2010-2014 and other policies. The national development plans and programmes had the objective of making the country more prosperous and raising living standards by diversifying the economy, integrating the domestic economy into the world economy and promoting education and public services. The cement and pharmaceutical industries were good pointers to the way forward: by 2015, the former would meet domestic needs, while the latter was due to double production with the creation of a bioequivalence laboratory and a biotechnology centre. The other strategic sectors were the steel industry, the engineering industry, including vehicles of all kinds, and the manufacturing industry, including a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises. Another target was the development of a competitive private sector: it was expected that, by 2015, the private sector\\'s share of GDP would rise to 60 per cent, as against 26 per cent in 1989. The promotion of modern industries, including pharmaceuticals, agro-industry and industries based on biotechnology, was beneficial not only to Algeria itself but also to regional integration. His Government was prepared to engage in closer regional cooperation. His delegation also urged UNIDO and Africa\\'s partners to support the programme on enhancing the competitiveness of African industries through increased and improved value addition adopted by the nineteenth Conference of African Ministers of Industry (CAMI) in Algiers in March 2011. The round tables organized by CAMI on agribusiness, pharmaceuticals and the biotechnology industries were of great importance for African countries, since those industries were in a position to ensure the continent\\'s food security at a time of climate change and enormous subsidies in the world agricultural production system and ensure their people\\'s health, which was affected by the heavy cost of medicines. It would be most useful to extend the UNIDO pilot project on agro-industry to more African countries and consider launching a pilot project to promote local pharmaceutical industries. In that connection, he expressed gratitude to UNIDO for increasing its assistance to regional economic communities in formulating and implementing cooperation projects. The Director-General\\'s support for Africa Industrialization Day, and the assistance and cooperation provided by UNIDO to African countries, was most welcome. Ms. Mutandiro (Zimbabwe) said that the growing demand for technical assistance from UNIDO was testimony to the Organization\\'s critical relevance to the economic development efforts of its Member States. Her Government appreciated the priority given by the Director-General to increasing technical cooperation delivery. It therefore endorsed the implementation of the Programme for Change and Organizational Renewal, which should result in a more accountable, efficient and effective Organization. The priority focus of development initiatives should always be technology transfer, investment in agro-industries and the improved energy access and capacity-building that were necessary for the attainment of sustainable industrial development. Her Government therefore endorsed the outcome of the nineteenth CAMI, which highlighted the importance of economic diversification in Africa based on value addition in the agro-industry, pharmaceutical and mineral sectors. The Tripartite Summit of Heads of State held in South Africa in June 2011, under the aegis of COMESA, the East African Community and SADC, had adopted a developmental approach to the tripartite integration process, based on the pillars of market integration, infrastructure development and industrial development. Her Government commended the Organization\\'s cooperation with FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and other development partners to promote value-chain development in Africa, build competitive food-supply systems and reduce reliance on food imports. Successful pilot projects had been held to that end in 12 countries and her delegation urged UNIDO to replicate them in other parts of Africa. The activities of UNIDO in building capacity and providing technical support in the area of supply-chain management, quality and standards would assist developing countries in increasing their share of global trade through adding value to their raw commodities. Although a number of measures had been taken to help developing countries gain better access to the global market, many countries had failed to do so, hampered by the absence of supply capacity and good quality infrastructure. Programmes run by UNIDO to promote job creation, particularly among young people and rural women, encouraged sustained growth and inclusive economic development. Greater focus and financial support should be given to such programmes. Zimbabwe had finalized its Industrial Development Policy, together with the National Trade Policy, the latter of which was a key component in implementing the former. The objective was to create a democratic developmental State through enhanced value addition, sustainable growth and industrial competitiveness. Her Government urged UNIDO to expend more effort in strengthening capacity-building for the production of generic drugs and the expansion of local pharmaceutical sectors in developing countries. A strengthened pharmaceutical sector benefiting from South-South and triangular cooperation would provide greater access to affordable drugs. UNIDO should promote further South-South cooperation, particularly by promoting business linkages for small and. medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SME development was a critical factor, since it created sustainable livelihoods and provided employment. Her Government had adopted the general principle of public-private partnerships and was in the process of finalizing the legal framework. Access to energy was the most fundamental requirement for industrial development and economic growth. UNIDO programmes seeking to reduce energy poverty in developing countries and create green industries utilizing energy-efficient technology and sustainable and clean energy were most welcome. Lastly, her delegation commended the establishment of the informal working group on the future, including programmes and resources, of UNIDO, which would serve as a platform to exchange ideas on making the Organization more relevant to the needs of Member States and more responsive to current and emerging global economic challenges. The working group should also seek to promote transparency, accountability and efficiency in the use of resources by the Organization, especially in the area of technical cooperation programmes.
